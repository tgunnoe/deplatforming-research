*** About
"When you buy a domain in our system, we're actually purchasing it for ourselves.
We will be the actual owners of the domain, it's not an ownership by proxy as
found with all other providers. However, you will still have the full control
over the domain name. You can either use our information, our nameservers or you
can go with your custom data.
...
The idea is to make sure that we minimise your visibility to the public. We're
not going to give your customer data out easily.
